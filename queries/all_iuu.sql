  -- Getting a list of iuu vessels

-- R. Joo v. 2021-03-15
-----------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------
-- Jaeyoon's query that pulls a list of the matched vessels recorded in the TMT IUU list.
-- JP: Iâ€™ve added a list of all registries to which the vessels are recorded,
-- the latest date of record of the vessel in the TMT list, and detailed notes about their being IUU written in the TMT website.
-- You can add 44 more vessels if you include loose_match on top of matched ones (a bunch of Chinese and Indian vessels).
-- If you need the raw list of the TMT IUU list, let me know.
