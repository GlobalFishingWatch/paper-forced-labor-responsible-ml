# forced-labor-trustability

This repository is a companion to the manuscript "Towards a responsible machine learning approach to identify forced labor at sea", from Roc√≠o Joo et al.

## `original` branch

* It contains the [codes](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/forced-labor-trustability/tree/main/scripts/model_repro_training_data.R) to do the analyses of the paper.
* There is no data available in this branch, so the codes cannot be run by external users.

* The first step here is to [run queries](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/prj-forced-labor/tree/model-paper/scripts/queries_premodel.r) to match tables of vessel information and compute movement patterns. 
* Then we [process](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/prj-forced-labor/tree/model-paper/scripts/queries_premodel.r) the data to be in the right format for the model.
* We [run](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/prj-forced-labor/tree/model-paper/scripts/model_run_non_repro.r) the model, do predictions, compute performance and fairness
* Need to add ports and other calculations

The reproducible codes (with data) used for the model and outputs are in branch `main`.
